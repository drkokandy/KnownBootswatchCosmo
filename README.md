# KnownBootswatchCosmo

This is my first attempt at a [Known](https://github.com/idno/known) theme.

Really, I just wanted my Known site to look a little more like my main website. So this is really just an attempt to apply the Cosmo theme from the excellent [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch) project to Known.

A significant portion of the PHP was just taken from one of the default themes and modified slightly.

Please file issues or bug reports if found.
