# KnownBootswatchCosmo

This is my first attempt at a [Known](https://github.com/idno/known) theme.

Really, I just wanted my Known site to look a little more like my main website. So this is really just an attempt to apply the Cosmo theme from the excellent [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch) project to Known.

A significant portion of the PHP was just taken from one of the default themes and modified slightly.

I'm not sure why the avatar is not to the left of each post. I thought it would be.

Please file issues or bug reports if found.
